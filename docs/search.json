However, we can observe more nuance in how female Gentoo penguins have shorter flippers on average than male Gentoo penguins.\nAdditionally, we can note that although Gentoo penguins only live on one island (Biscoe Island), Adélie penguins live on three different islands (Biscoe, Dream, and Torgersen Islands), and their mean flipper measurements vary by both island and sex."

Within all three species, male penguins tend to have longer flippers than female penguins. Gentoo and Chinstrap penguins each only live on one island (Biscoe Island and Dream Island, respectively), while Adélie penguins live on three different islands (Biscoe, Dream, and Torgersen Islands). In Adélie penguins, there are notable differences in each island population’s distribution of flipper measurements.
