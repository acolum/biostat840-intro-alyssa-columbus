# Background

## Question

How do flipper lengths compare across three penguin species (i.e., Adélie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo) observed on three different islands in the Palmer Archipelago of Antarctica in 2008?

## Audience

The intended audience for this data analysis is anyone who is interested in exploring data about Antarctic penguins' flipper measurements with R.

## Original Data

The original data in this analysis is the [`penguins` dataset](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/penguins.html) from the [`palmerpenguins` package](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) [@palmerpenguins]. This dataset contains size measurements of adult foraging penguins near the Palmer Station in Antarctica.

### Description

According to the [`palmerpenguins` package's documentation](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/), data was collected on three different penguin species and released by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pallter.marine.rutgers.edu/). All of the observations were recorded in 2007-2009 and originally published in 2014 [@gorman2014ecological].

### Data Dictionary

The documentation for the `penguins` dataset provides [a comprehensive data dictionary](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/penguins.html).

# Analysis

## Setup

::: callout-tip
## Setting Up for Success

First, we need to load the `tidyverse` set of packages [@tidyverse] and the `penguins` dataset.
:::

::: column-margin
The `tidyverse` is a collection of open source R packages built for data manipulation, exploration, and visualization.

More information can be found at <https://www.tidyverse.org>.
:::

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load the tidyverse
library(tidyverse)
# Load the `penguins` dataset
penguins <- palmerpenguins::penguins
```

## Data Wrangling

::: callout-note
## Wrangling Penguins

To wrangle the `penguins` dataset, we will primarily use the `tidyverse` packages, `dplyr` and `tidyr`.
:::

Let's clean up this dataset by:

-   removing all NAs,

-   filtering to only include observations from 2008,

-   replacing all observations spelled "Adelie" with "Adélie,"

-   capitalizing "male" and "female," and

-   selecting only variables that are relevant to this analysis.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Using `dplyr` and `tidyr` to wrangle `penguins`
wrangled_penguins <- penguins %>% 
  # Remove NA values from all columns
  tidyr::drop_na() %>% 
  # Filter to only include observations from 2008
  dplyr::filter(year == 2008) %>% 
  # Replace all "Adelie" values with "Adélie" and capitalize "male" and "female"
  dplyr::mutate(dplyr::across('species', stringr::str_replace, 'Adelie', 'Adélie'),
                sex = stringr::str_to_title(sex)) %>% 
  # Select only the species, island, flipper_length_mm, and sex variables
  dplyr::select(species, island, flipper_length_mm, sex)

# Glimpsing this new, wrangled dataset
dplyr::glimpse(wrangled_penguins)
```

Now, let's quantitatively explore this dataset. Overall, what is the average flipper length (in mm) for each of the three penguin species?

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Finding the average flipper length (in mm) for each penguin species
wrangled_penguins %>% 
  # Group the wrangled `penguins` by species
  dplyr::group_by(species) %>% 
  # Compute the average flipper length for each species
  dplyr::summarize(mean(flipper_length_mm))
```

Clearly, Gentoo penguins have the longest flipper length on average of the three species.

Let's dig a little deeper. What is the average flipper length (in mm) for each of the three penguin species when also considering their island habitats and sexes?

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Finding the average flipper length (in mm) for each penguin species,
# also taking into account their island and sex
wrangled_penguins %>% 
  # Group the wrangled `penguins` by species, island, and sex
  dplyr::group_by(species, island, sex) %>% 
  # Compute the average flipper length for these groups
  dplyr::summarize(mean(flipper_length_mm))
```

From this table, we can gather that Gentoo penguins still have the longest flipper length on average of the three species. However, we can observe more nuance in how female Gentoo penguins have shorter flippers on average than male Gentoo penguins.

Additionally, we can note that although Gentoo penguins only live on one island (Biscoe Island), Adélie penguins live on three different islands (Biscoe, Dream, and Torgersen Islands), and their mean flipper measurements vary by both island and sex.

## Data Visualization

::: callout-note
## Visualizing Penguin Patterns

To visually explore the `penguins` dataset, we will use the `ggplot2` package [@ggplot2].
:::

Let's dig even deeper into our analysis by visualizing the distributions of flipper lengths by species.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=8}
# Making a plot of the distributions of flipper lengths by species, faceted by species
ggplot(data = wrangled_penguins, mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm)) +  
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, boundary = 0,  
                 color = "black", fill = "lightblue") +  
  labs(title = "Distributions of Flipper Lengths by Antarctic Penguin Species",
       subtitle = "Compared to Adélie and Chinstrap penguins, Gentoo penguins generally appear to have longer flippers.",
       caption = "Data Source: palmerpenguins",
       x = "Flipper Length (mm)",  
       y = "Frequency of Penguin Observations") +  
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05))) +  
  theme_minimal() +  
  facet_wrap(vars(species))
```

Although this plot nicely shows the distinct distributions of the three species' flipper lengths, it is difficult to accurately compare the distributions and their key characteristics (e.g., their means). A more effective way to visualize these three distributions and compare them is to use boxplots instead of histograms.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=8}
# Making a plot of the distributions of flipper lengths by species with boxplots
ggplot(data = wrangled_penguins, mapping = aes(x = species, y = flipper_length_mm)) +  
  geom_boxplot(color = "black", fill = "lightblue") +  
  labs(title = "Comparing Distributions of Flipper Lengths by Antarctic Penguin Species",
       subtitle = "Gentoo penguins, followed by Chinstrap and Adélie penguins, have longer flippers.",
       caption = "Data Source: palmerpenguins",
       x = "Species",
       y = "Flipper Length (mm)") +  
  theme_minimal()
```

From this plot, it's much more clear that Gentoo penguins, followed by Chinstrap and Adélie penguins, respectively, have the longest flippers.

Let's extend this analysis of flipper length distributions to also include the penguins' island habitats and sexes.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=8}
# Making a plot of the distributions of flipper lengths by species, faceted by island and sex
ggplot(data = wrangled_penguins, mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, group = species, fill = species)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4) + 
  labs(title = "Distributions of Flipper Lengths by Antarctic Penguin Species, Faceted by Sex and Island",
       subtitle = "Male penguins on Biscoe Island tend to have the longest flippers, followed by females on the same island.",
       caption = "Data Source: palmerpenguins",
       x = "Flipper Length (mm)",  
       y = "Density of Penguin Observations",
       fill = "Species") +  
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05))) +  
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#45b6fe", "#296d98", "#0e2433")) +
  theme_minimal() +  
  facet_grid(vars(island), vars(sex))
```

Similar to the point we noted above in our quantitative exploration of the dataset, there is more nuance captured in visually analyzing flipper length distributions when also considering the penguins' habitats and sexes.

## Summary

Overall, Gentoo penguins have the largest flipper lengths on average, followed by Chinstrap and Adélie penguins, respectively. Within all three species, male penguins tend to have longer flippers than female penguins. Gentoo and Chinstrap penguins each only live on one island (Biscoe Island and Dream Island, respectively), while Adélie penguins live on three different islands (Biscoe, Dream, and Torgersen Islands). In Adélie penguins, there are notable differences in each island population's distribution of flipper measurements. Regardless of sex, Adélie penguins that live on Biscoe Island generally have the shortest flippers.
